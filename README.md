# Near-field current measurement post-processing
This python script performs frequency-based post-processing to recover a current
waveform from a raw voltage measurement of a near-field sensor.

Inputs:
* S-parameters response of the probe in a calibration setup
* Transient voltage waveform accross the probe

Output:
* Transient waveform of the current through the probed wire/pcb track/silicon-level track

# Run
